## Why "Sparrow"?

Sparrow is a portmanteau name combining three key concepts:
SPArse Matrix + ARROW Syntax + ROW-Based Storage

- **Sparse** - Represents sparse matrix processing - the core focus of the library for efficient handling of matrices with mostly zero values.
- **Arrow** (â†’) - Dual meaning:
  - Pipe Syntax (|>): Reflects functional programming patterns for chaining operations
  - Graph Edges: Symbolizes directed connections in graph-based computations

The name Sparrow draws deliberate inspiration from avian flocks - natural formations where thousands of birds collectively create ever-shifting graph structures in the sky. 

## The story behind the logo

When the project began as a creative experiment, I jokingly envisioned my partner as a modern-day greek muse. 
Over time, this idea transformed into reality.

The final artwork, crafted by her talented best friend (inst: @doubledecker_balls), depicts my lovely girlfriend with the weird hairline which resembles either a book or spectral graph layout graphics

## Why do this exist?

Solely for my artistic needs, do not use it for serious mathematical researches
